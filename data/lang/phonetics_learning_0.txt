It was a hot summer day. A grasshopper was lying in the shade, relaxing from the heat of the sun when an ant passed by.
The ant was dragging a huge apple in order to store it for the winter.
Just looking at the ant made the grasshopper feel tired.
Ant, why do you work all day long? Why donâ€™t you sit for a while and sing a song with me?
he asked, and he took out his violin.
I am gathering food for the winter when it will be cold and there will be no food.
It would be a good idea if you did the same, the ant answered. approach
